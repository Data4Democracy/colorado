Highlighting local Data for Democracy code &amp; projects from the Denver & Boulder chapters.

# About Us

Data for Democracy is a volunteer-organized and driven community interested in data science projects for social justice.
If you're new to Data for Democracy, we recommend looking at the projects featured on [datafordemocracy.org](http://datafordemocracy.org/projects.html) to see what D4D members are doing on a national level.

The Denver and Boulder chapters are interested in developing local projects and making community connections in Colorado.

(Have an idea / a dataset? We'd love to hear it!)

# Getting Started

Don't be shy -- we welcome folks of all technical levels / backgrounds interested in social justice issues.

## Meetup.com

We have a brand new [Denver meetup.com page](https://www.meetup.com/Data-for-Democracy-Denver/) that will be kept updated for in-person meeting dates (tentatively at Galvanize Platte for Denver meetups & The Cup for Boulder meet-ups). A Boulder meetup page, as well as a regular meeting schedule are on the to-do list.

## Slack

However, most active discussion of projects in between meetups happens on Slack, a team collaboration / communication tool.

To join Slack, you can either follow the [D4D onboarding](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/read-this-first) instructions, or message one of the leads on Github for an invite (see next section). Then, join the [#city-boulder](http://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/city-boulder)
and [#city-denver](http://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/city-denver) channels. Alternatively, another member can invite you during one of our meetups.

## Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct](./CodeOfConduct.md) describes our lightweight community rules & values to keep meetups and Slack interactions inclusive and welcoming.

# On-Going Projects

## How to Highlight Projects

We're manually updating this at the moment. D4D Denver/Boulder members are absolutely welcome to host projects on their own Github repos and submit a pull request to have the project featured here. (Note: we will likely move to using the Issues tab / a tabular format to organize projects & press in the future.)

* **Increasing Access and Assessing Impact of Oil & Gas Development:** Text/.pdf scraping and machine learning for AirWaterGas (airwatergas.org), an unbiased public resource aggregating and organizing public oil & gas / fracking regulatory data.
* **Evaluating Representation in City of Boulder City Council Meetings:** Using city council agendas and speakers, we aim to assess whether different neighborhoods/demographics equally represented in their communication with city officials.
* **Investigating Residential Teardowns in Denver Neighborhoods:** Using building permit information scraped from the Denver government website to access the locations and number of Residential Teardowns followed by New Construction which can heavily influence housing prices in the Denver area. [[code](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/colorado/tree/master/denver_teardowns)]
* **Evaluating Increase in Oil & Gas Drilling Permit Activity Since the New Administration:** Reviewing the public Oil & Gas Drilling Permits for Colorado to see if there's already been a significant increase in permits issued.  And determining, if this increase exists, when this change happened and what other factors could be a cause of this increase, as well. [[code](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/colorado/tree/master/oilgas_well_permits)]
* **Examining Racial Bias in Police Stops:** Examining the Front Range area in Stanford's [Open Policing](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) dataset. [[code](https://github.com/samzhang111/co-police-stops)] [[media coverage](http://news.kgnu.org/2017/07/resistance-radio-data-for-democracy-racial-disparities-in-police-traffic-stops/)]
