Highlighting local Data for Democracy code &amp; projects from the Denver & Boulder chapters.

# About Us

Data for Democracy is a volunteer organized and driven community interested in data science projects for social justice.
If you're new to Data for Democracy, we recommend looking at the projects featured on [datafordemocracy.org](http://datafordemocracy.org/projects.html) to see what D4D members are doing on a national level.

The Denver and Boulder chapters are interested in developing local projects and making community connections in Colorado.

(Have an idea / a dataset? We'd love to hear about it!)

# Getting Started

Don't be shy -- we welcome folks of all technical levels / backgrounds.

We have a brand new [denver_meetup.com page](https://www.meetup.com/Data-for-Democracy-Denver/) that will be kept up-to-date for in-person meeting dates at Galvanize-Platte

A Boulder meetup group is in the works, with meetings to be held at The Cup.

However, most active discussion of projects in between meetups happens on Slack, a team collaboration / communication tool.

To join Slack, you can either follow the [D4D onboarding](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/read-this-first) instructions, or message one of the leads on Github for an invite (see next section). Then, join the [#city-boulder](http://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/city-boulder)
and [#city-denver](http://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/city-denver) channels. Alternatively, another member can invite you during one of our meetups.

# On-Going Project Descriptions

* **Increasing Access and Assessing Impact of Oil & Gas Development:** Text/.pdf scraping and machine learning for AirWaterGas (airwatergas.org), an unbiased public resource aggregating and organizing public oil & gas / fracking regulatory data.
* **Evaluating Representation in City of Boulder City Council Meetings:** Using city council agendas and speakers, we aim to assess whether different neighborhoods/demographics equally represented in their communication with city officials.
* **Investigating Residential Teardowns in Denver Neighborhoods:** Using building permit information scraped from the Denver government website to access the locations and number of Residential Teardowns followed by New Construction which can heavily influence housing prices in the Denver area. [[code](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/colorado/tree/master/denver_teardowns)]
* **Evaluating Increase in Oil & Gas Drilling Permit Activity Since the New Administration:** Reviewing the public Oil & Gas Drilling Permits for Colorado to see if there's already been a significant increase in permits issued.  And determining, if this increase exists, when this change happened and what other factors could be a cause of this increase, as well. [[code](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/colorado/tree/master/oilgas_well_permits)]
* **Examining Racial Bias in Police Stops:** Examining the Front Range area in Stanford's [Open Policing](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) dataset. [[code](https://github.com/samzhang111/co-police-stops)] [[media coverage](http://news.kgnu.org/2017/07/resistance-radio-data-for-democracy-racial-disparities-in-police-traffic-stops/)]
