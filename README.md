# On-Going Project Descriptions

* **Increasing Access and Assessing Impact of Oil & Gas Development:** Text/.pdf scraping and machine learning for AirWaterGas (airwatergas.org), an unbiased public resource aggregating and organizing public oil & gas / fracking regulatory data.
* **Evaluating Representation in City of Boulder City Council Meetings:** Using city council agendas and speakers, we aim to assess whether different neighborhoods/demographics equally represented in their communication with city officials.
* **Analyzing Outcomes from Colorado and Boulder County police
* **Investigating Residential Teardowns in Denver Neighborhoods:** Using building permit information scraped from the Denver government website to access the locations and number of Residential Teardowns followed by New Construction which can heavily influence housing prices in the Denver area.
* **Evaluating Increase in Oil & Gas Drilling Permit Activity Since the New Administration:** Reviewing the public Oil & Gas Drilling Permits for Colorado to see if there's already been a significant increase in permits issued.  And determining, if this increase exists, when this change happened and what other factors could be a cause of this increase, as well.
