**Marijuana**
- some datasets posted on (https://data.colorado.gov/) that we could explore. Crime statistics, other drug usage, hospitalizations down (from alcohol or other drugs)?
- Did medical marijuana usage go down after legalization?
**Food Deserts** – Choo is interested in this one.  
- Food deserts in Denver (long distance to buy food and grocery stores)?
**Sidewalks in Denver** – Gretchen is interested in this one.
- Often no sidewalks to get to bus stops, makes it harder for those without a vehicle to get around (especially people with strollers or wheelchairs).
**Detecting Pep the Frog in Twitter avatars**
- @metasemantic created this dataset.  He's not in #city-denver channel, but would like to work on this with someone.
**Detecting swastikas in avatars on Twitter**
- Similar to the Pepe the Frog project, could even be combined (Pepe, Swastika, or neutral)
**Animal Shelter**
- Explore options with this data, available on (https://data.colorado.gov/).
**Traffic**
- Finding safest/most dangerous intersections in Denver based on accidents.
- Finding main features that cause unsafe intersections.  
- Most dangerous intersections for pedestrians?  Bikers?  
- This data may be available on the Colorado gov data site, as well...or we can request it from the city.

**EPA Related Projects:**
**Oil/Gas Spills**
- Number of oil/gas spills vs. # of wells?  vs. volume of production? vs. bad operators (companies with higher number of infractions)?
**County Drilling Regulations**
- Some counties have less stringent regulations.
- How do the regulations relate to public health?
- High well density in Weld & Garfield counties
**Mapping well locations**
- COGCC used to have updated map of this, but have taken it down from site (due to too many complaint calls about wells that they didn’t have the personnel to handle).
- Home buyers often buying homes near areas that oil & gas companies had rights to drill on but hadn’t put a well in yet.  In some counties wells only need to be 150ft from home or school structure (not property line).
**Water & Soil Sampling at WellSites**
- Doing some kind of analysis on the water & soil sampling near wells with complaints
- Available on COGCC site
- COGCC usually does sampling at sites with complaints
- EPA is the 2nd tier of complaints (when not much being done about complaint by the COGCC, individuals contact EPA) and does soil & water sampling beyond that West of 98th meridian – industries are allowed to discharge waste to surface
- Need PDES permits (Pollutant Discharge Elimination System), I believe available on the COGCC site.
- Company needs to give reason why they need to discharge their waste (too expensive to get rid of waster in other way, etc.)
- This somewhat filtered waste water has been used to water crops in California & elsewhere (even organic crops), been used to irrigate land used to grow food for livestock, and in some cases even been used as drinking water for migrant workers.
**Analyzing Changes in Groundwater Volume**
- USGS & NASA may have data here (though NASA is supposed to focus on space science instead of earth science from now on per the current administration).  NASA has some satellite images mapping this, I believe.
**EPA & government layoff tracking**
- How much of the EPA and other government workers are being laid off during the current administration?  Many citizens are employed by the government.  Is Trump’s creation of jobs in the coal industry and elsewhere “trumped” (pun!) by his dissolution of government jobs?
**Investigating scaling back of NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act)**
- Less regulation
