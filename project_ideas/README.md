# colorado > project ideas readme

We're going to keep maintain a list of project ideas here for folks to browse for brainstorming local projects to work on.

Many of these are projects that community members have pitched with enthusiasm but may not have the bandwidth to "lead". (In general, we feel that projects are more likely to get done if there's a D4D member or community stakeholder pushing it forward.)

Thus, if you're interested in one of these ideas, offer to work on it on Slack/at a meetup, it's likely that you'll find a lot of support!

Sorry, organization of `./project_ideas/` still under development, but we'll likely open this section up to pull requests: that is, feel free to submit a pull request if you have an idea you want to highlight here!
