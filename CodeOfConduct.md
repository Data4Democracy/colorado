# Code of Conduct

1) **Speak out against harassment and discrimination.** Absolutely no discrimination by age, race, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, socioeconomic status, disability, or belief.
2) **"Yes, and" ideas.** During idea pitches and initial brainstorming sessions, we favor an approach of first accepting the underlying project idea, then attempting to add more to the idea. While being critical is also needed and has its time and place, this encourages new voices and leads to creative new ideas.
3) **Err on giving credit.** When possible, try to credit all contributions to project ideas, code, and analysis strategies (say, in code comments or a readme file). While individual contributions can be difficult to keep track of in the free-form, collaborative environment we wish to foster, it's essential that all community members' contributions are acknowledged and no one feels undervalued.
4) **No vertical structure.** while we have city leads that help organize the channel and make the last call on decisions (e.g., meeting times), every member's opinion is equally valued, regardless of the length of time in the community. All decisions will be democratic when possible.
5) **Respect others' learning and backgrounds.** No one can truly master every aspect of data science. Different community members have different strengths and perspectives. Try not to feign surprise ("wow, i can't believe you've never worked with S3 before") or state subjective opinions as fact ("well actually, my approach to this SQL query is best").

Inspiration for this Code of Conduct comes from the fantastic folks of the [Code for Denver](https://github.com/codefordenver/codeofconduct), the [Data for Democracy Hackathon CoC](http://datafordemocracy.org/hackathon_coc.html), the [Spatial Community](https://github.com/TheSpatialCommunity/documents/blob/master/COC.md), and the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules).
